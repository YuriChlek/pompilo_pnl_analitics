# Client Standards

## Purpose

This document defines the required naming and structural conventions for the `client` application.

The goal is consistency:

- predictable file locations
- predictable file names
- predictable ownership of types
- minimal ambiguity during refactoring

## Naming Rules

### General

- Use `kebab-case` for all `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css` file names.
- Use `PascalCase` for React components and exported classes.
- Use `camelCase` for functions, variables, hooks internals, and constants that are not global-style constants.
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only for true constants that behave like static configuration values.

### Required file suffixes

- Interfaces: `*.interfaces.ts`
- Types: `*.types.ts`
- Enums: `*.enums.ts`
- Config: `*.config.ts`
- Server helpers: descriptive kebab-case, for example `get-current-user.ts`
- Utility files: descriptive kebab-case, for example `route-access.ts`

### Reserved framework names

Do not rename framework-reserved files:

- `page.tsx`
- `layout.tsx`
- `route.ts`
- `loading.tsx`
- `error.tsx`
- `not-found.tsx`
- `index.ts`
- `proxy.ts`

## Feature Module Structure

Each feature under `src/features` should use this structure when applicable:

```text
module-foo/
├── api-service/
├── components/
├── config/
├── enums/
├── hooks/
├── interfaces/
├── lib/
├── server/
└── types/
```

Not every module must contain every folder, but new code must follow this shape when the concern exists.

## What Goes Where

### `interfaces/`

Use `interfaces/` for stable object contracts:

- API entities
- service contracts
- DTO-like frontend payloads
- shared component prop contracts when they are reused across files

Examples:

- `User`
- `TradingAccount`
- `ApiKeyPayload`
- `TradingAccountService`

### `types/`

Use `types/` for:

- unions
- mapped types
- helper types
- local shared props types
- result/context/scope helper types

Examples:

- `TradingAccountAnalyticsPeriod`
- `AuthScope`
- `RouteContext`
- `RefreshResult`

### `enums/`

Use `enums/` only for enums.

Examples:

- `UserRoles`
- `COOKIE_NAMES`
- `MenuTypes`

### `config/`

Use `config/` for static module configuration objects.

Examples:

- auth scope map
- menu config
- route access config

### `lib/`

Use `lib/` for pure module utilities:

- formatters
- small deterministic helpers
- path or route helpers

Do not place domain contracts in `lib/`.

### `api-service/`

Use `api-service/` only for transport-level communication with backend endpoints.

Rules:

- no UI logic
- no React hooks
- no component state
- normalize server responses here when possible

### `hooks/`

Use `hooks/` for React Query hooks and stateful UI hooks.

Rules:

- hooks may compose services
- hooks should not contain large view logic
- query normalization should happen before JSX when possible

### `components/`

Use `components/` for React UI only.

Rules:

- one exported component per file
- if a helper component grows beyond trivial size, move it to its own file
- keep files focused on rendering and interaction

## Component Rules

- Prefer one exported component per `.tsx` file.
- Private helper components may stay in the same file only if they are very small and not reused.
- Shared component prop types must live in `types/` or `interfaces/`, not randomly inside multiple components.
- Avoid mixing data shaping and rendering in the same large component.

## Import Rules

- Import enums from `enums/`.
- Import interfaces from `interfaces/`.
- Import helper types from `types/`.
- Avoid importing from old file names after rename.
- Prefer direct imports over broad barrel usage unless the barrel is a deliberate public API.

## Data Handling Rules

- Do not spread `response.data?.…` through components.
- Normalize nullable or optional response data at the service or hook boundary.
- Prefer typed fallback objects over repeated optional chaining in JSX.

## Tests

- Test fixtures should use the same domain interfaces/types as production code.
- Test-only probe components may live inside test files.
- Do not let test helpers define conventions for production structure.

## Refactor Policy

When touching a module:

1. Keep naming aligned with this document.
2. Move newly introduced shared contracts into the correct folder.
3. Update imports immediately after rename or extraction.
4. Run client tests after structural changes.

## Review Checklist

Before merging frontend code, verify:

- file names are `kebab-case`
- enums are only in `enums/`
- reusable interfaces are in `interfaces/`
- helper/shared types are in `types/`
- no oversized multi-component files without reason
- no stale imports to renamed files
- no repeated `data?.…` usage where typed normalization is possible
